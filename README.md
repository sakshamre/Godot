# Godot

Created two demos for Drydock studios, Platformer_1 and Cromulent_Conduct

# Cromulent Conduct

Why is the bunny sad? What can he do to achieve happiness? The game aims to answer these questions via gameplay. 
The game is incomplete, level 3 and 4 are yet to be added, and a lot more changes in general. 
Also, due to the large size of the project, the source files couldn't be pushed to git, though you can check the demo video in the link [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FkRn2wWHvkCjlbL7rCan4kffXviAZ4Ua/view?usp=sharing "Cromulent Conduct Demo")
